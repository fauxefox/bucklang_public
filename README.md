# BuckLang_CSCI341

BuckLang is a basic command language for programming two-way Turing machines covered in Bucknell's [CSCI 341 Theory of Computation course in Fall 2025](https://toddtoddtodd.net/courses/csci341/compiled/csci341_index.html).
It is based on the "WB" language taught as part of [Stanford's CS 203 Mathematical Foundations of Computing course taught in 2012](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1132/) (as well as other years).
